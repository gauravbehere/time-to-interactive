/**
 * Time to interactive
 * Utility to report time to interactive for Real User Monitoring (RUM)
 * 
 * Usage: 
 * window.getPageTTI.then(data => //data is the TTI value for the page)
 * window.getReferentialTTI().then(data => //data is the TTI value for a section/component)
 * 
 * Referential TTI can be fired from the click event, route navigations when you render a component or an event 
 * after which you want to check how much is the time to interactive for that action
 * 
 * Basic idea is to make use of LongTask API to see if CPU was busy & report time to interactive based on 
 * the number of CPU cycles for which CPU was busy.
 * 
 * Algorithm:
 * 1. First attempt is to see if PerformanceLongTaskTiming is available in window.
 * 2. If it is available we report TTI as max of time to load & TTI reported by tti-polyfill.
 * 3. There are instances where TTI reported by tti-polyfill is less than time for loadEventEnd, thus we return a max of the two.
 * 4. If PerformanceLongTaskTiming is not available we fall back to manual polling to check if CPU is busy.
 * 5. As we get a window of 500ms for which CPU was idle, 
 *    we report TTI based on the number of cycles we had to wait to see a idle 500ms window.
 * 6. We look for the idle window after loadEventEnd has happened so that we are also waiting network idle state.
